# Version 2

## V2.0
The sketch for V2.0 runs the ESP8266 and the MMA8452Q. The device will send a webhook to IFTTT anytime either of the sensors detect a value outside of the expected range. V2.0 supports one orientation. V2.0 also supports saving the credentials on device storage using EEPROM, and it works with the device application.
