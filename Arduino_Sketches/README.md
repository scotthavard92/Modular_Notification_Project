# Arduino Sketches
These are various Arduino sketches that were built independently while working on the project. These sketches are for individual sensors,
or are a of combination of the sensors and the ESP8266.

## Sketch Descriptions
* **Accelerometer_Sketch.ino:** This sketch reports values using the MM84552Q Acclerometer.
* **Hardware_Combination_ValueCheck.ino:** This sketch monitors values from both the MM84552Q Accelerometer and VCNL4010 Proximity Sensor and reports deviation froman initial value.
* **Hardware_Integration.ino:** This sketch combines the MM8452Q Accelerometer and VCNL4010 Proximity Sensor and monitors values. 
* **IFTTT_Communication.ino:** This sketch sends a webhook to IFTTT using the ESP8266.
* **Proximity_Sensor.ino:** This sketch reports values using the VCNL4010 Proximity Sensor.
